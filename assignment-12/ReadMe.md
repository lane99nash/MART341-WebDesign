What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?
Borders define the amount of space a box/element takes up, and the relationship to other boxes. They are more of a visual styling tool.
Padding is the amount of space between the inner content of the element and the element itself.
Margins are the space between the box/element and other elements, or the edge of the parent element.
