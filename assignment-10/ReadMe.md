Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

Universal styles every element on a page, so it would only be used if you want everything to be uniform. Element selects all elements of a certain type (for example, p, h1, etc.). This would be good for a specific area. Class selectors are used for elements that serve the same function, usually in div. ID define style rules for a specific element.

Discuss your color palette. How did you choose your colors?

For my palette, I just chose colors from the main colors used in the poster of Back to the Future. Those colors being yellow, orange, and dark blue, which happen to be split complimentary and work well together.
