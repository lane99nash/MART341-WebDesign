  <h2>THE LAND OF FIRE AND ICE</h2>

<p class="content">Iceland is a country of extreme contrasts and dramatic landscapes. Widely known as "the land of fire and ice," Iceland is home to some of the largest glaciers in Europe and some of the world's most active volcanoes.
Iceland is also the land of light and darkness. Long summer days with near 24-hours of sunshine are offset by short winter days with only a few hours of gloomy daylight—the perfect scenario for enjoying the magical Northern lights.</p>

<p>Iceland has a much milder climate than could be expected from its name and location on the globe. A branch of the Gulf stream brings warmer seas up to the south and west coast, moderating the climate significantly. However, it brings milder Atlantic air to meet Arctic air, resulting in frequent weather changes and storminess. There are significant regional differences in the weather with the northern part experiencing colder winter months and warmer summers than the south.
The average temperature in Reykjavík is +0.4°C in January and 12.5°C in July. The average for the year is 5.5°C. The average yearly precipitation in Reykjavík is 890.
