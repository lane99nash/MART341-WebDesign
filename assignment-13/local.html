<p class="archie-bray">
  <a href="https://archiebray.org/" class='website-link'>Archie Bray Foundation</a> for the Ceramic Arts (The Bray) was founded at the foothills of the Montana Rockies in 1951 by entrepreneur, brickmaker, and avid arts patron Archie Bray, who intended it to be a place to “make available for all who are seriously interested in the ceramic arts, a fine place to work.” The primary mission is to provide an environment and connection with other serious artists that stimulates creative work in ceramics.

  Located on the site of the former Western Clay Manufacturing Company, the 26-acre historic brickyard campus has more than 17 buildings, including a 12,000-square-foot resident artist studio facility, a new education and research facility, multiple sales and exhibition galleries, renovated administrative offices, and a facility for ceramic retail and manufacturing. The property is open to artists, students, gallery visitors, and ceramic supply customers, as well as the general public for classes, gallery visits, retail activity, self-guided tours, and structured group visits.

     mission is to promote the ceramic arts within Helena and the surrounding community by providing support and education through individual and community workspace, classes, seminars and shared resources.

    Back In 1999, a small group ceramic artists, who outgrew class area at the Archie Bray, decided to start their own work space. From that original group of seven artists the Clay Arts Guild was founded. Today The Guild is a 501c(3) non-profit organization with a membership of 50-70 practicing clay artists, (and one attention-demanding cat).

    We are governed by an all-volunteer eight-member board which meets about once a month. Each May an annual membership meeting is held annual elections, information sharing and for major business decisions.

    We are located in an industrial park on eastern edge of Helena, Montana - and bring a bit of class to an otherwise drab portion of Helena.
