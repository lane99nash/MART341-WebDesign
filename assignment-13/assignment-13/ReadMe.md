My testing session was what I was expecting. I thought the feed back was informative and I agree on the critiques and suggestions that were given. I plan on adding a video or two on the technique page and add my citations to the pages.
I originally had issues with my pages not scrolling, but it turned out to be an easy solution (thank you). After that it was easy to keep working on the website.
