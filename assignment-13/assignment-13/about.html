  Wheel throwing is the technique of shaping round ceramics using a potters wheel. The 'throwing' is the shaping part. The wheels turns constantly, either triggered by a foot or motor, meaning the clay and the pot rotates so you can mould it into your desired shape with your two hands. The wheel is also used in the process of trimming and adding decorations or different rings of colour. This is done in conjunction with special potters tools.
  <br />
  Much of the early ceramic work was using hand building techniques. The wheel came about around 4500 BC in areas around Turkey and Egypt. These early wheels were turned by hand or foot while coiling a pot. This form of slow wheel was used very little - it was not until the discovery of fly wheel principle that the fast wheel in the late 3rd millennium BC was used.
<br />
With potters being able to create many more pots per hour, the use of the fast wheel was a step towards industrialisation. Much further forward in time, the motor-driven wheel has become popular with craft potters and educational institutions, although human powered wheels are still favoured by many studio potters.

  <p class="hand-building">
    Handbuilding is an ancient pottery-making technique that involves creating forms without a pottery wheel, using the hands, fingers, and simple tools. The most common handbuilding techniques are pinch pottery, coil building, and slab building.
  <br />
    To make a pinch pot, one inserts a thumb into a ball of clay and continually pinches the the clay between the thumb and fingers while rotating to thin out and raise the height of the vessel. Pinching can deliver a pleasingly organic look, but can also yield beautiful, refined results. Coil building is a forming method that uses ropelike coils of plastic clay, assembled in successive courses to build up wall of vessel or sculpture.
